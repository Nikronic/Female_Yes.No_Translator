# Female Yes/No Translator
This is a translator to help you understand the <strong>"Yes" is yes or no</strong> and vice versa. (Recommended usage for boys)

# Theory 
I think <strong>random decision</strong> is more accurate than NLP and Deep Learning techniques. Because these techniques are based on human learning system and human cannot translate this <strong>YES/NO</strong> answers to real yes/no.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
This repo is <strong>ONLY FOR FUN</strong> and I have no attitude to say anything to women. 
My mother is woman and I love her more than anything in this world! So just have fun!
